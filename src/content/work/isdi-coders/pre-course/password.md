description: Created for the ISDICoders bootcamp pre-course, Dragon Ball Pasapalabra was my inaugural project. Despite not being required, I chose to invest considerable effort to showcase my potential. This game, inspired by the Dragon Ball universe, stands as a testament to my commitment and learning in web development.
